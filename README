Magento Controller Dispatch
--------------------------------------------------
The following files will enable some simple logging that traces Magento's routing and controller dispatch.  A few caveats

1. These files are not a true Magento module.  While powerful, creating something like this with Magento's override system would be an order of magnitude harder.

2. Because of the above, I can't make any promises about using this with a anything but Magneto version 1.4.2.0	

3. Standard Caveats about production servers apply.  Use at your own risk, no warranties, etc.

Installing
--------------------------------------------------
Take the "Mage" folder and place it in 

	app/code/local
	
so that your directory tree looks like 

local/Mage/Core/Controller/Varien/Action.php
local/Mage/Core/Controller/Varien/Front.php
local/Mage/Core/Controller/Varien/Router/Standard.php
local/Mage/Core/Model/App.php

Then, enable logging (see http://alanstorm.com/magento_log_and_developer_mode for more information)

You should now see messages in your system log that look something like 

	2009-09-20T16:55:48+00:00 DEBUG (7): Matching router [standard] = Mage_Core_Controller_Varien_Router_Standard  vs. request
	2009-09-20T16:55:48+00:00 DEBUG (7): Module: helloworld
	2009-09-20T16:55:48+00:00 DEBUG (7): Found Modules: Array
	(
		[0] => Alanstormdotcom_Helloworld
	)

	2009-09-20T16:55:48+00:00 DEBUG (7): Setting Route Name [helloworld] on request
	2009-09-20T16:55:48+00:00 DEBUG (7): Passing request into controller Alanstormdotcom_Helloworld_IndexController
	2009-09-20T16:55:48+00:00 DEBUG (7): Setting Module Name to: helloworld at Mage_Core_Controller_Varien_Router_Standard::match(248)

	2009-09-20T16:55:48+00:00 DEBUG (7): Action Controller: Alanstormdotcom_Helloworld_IndexController dispatching with action [index]
	 
You'll also see a message whenever Matchento can't make a module, controller, or action match, which is useful is debugging 404 problems.
